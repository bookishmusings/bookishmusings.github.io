*pub date: october 8, 2024*

**Rachel Weiss's Group Chat**, by Lauren Appelbaum

*pub date: september 24, 2024*

**book description**: Opposites attract in this romantic comedy, "as hilarious as it is heartwarming," about feeling stuck, the importance of friendship, and learning to open your heart. (Falon Ballard, author of Right on Cue)


**book review**: I always read Jane Austen adaptations with the utmost interest because there are so many novel and unique ways to modernize them. This one was NOT marketed as one, but you could tell from the start that that’s where it’s going. I wasn’t a fan of that.
I thought the book would have been so much more effective if it was either a looser adaptation or a tighter adaptation, because as a lay reader I’m obviously inadvertently comparing it to the source material, which is super unfair. All that said, if you really take the source material out, this would have been a fascinating book about growing up in your late twenties. The feeling of the carpet getting pulled from under you, while all your friends are building something is done so well here.
However, the absolutely insane thing the MC did in Vegas was a bit too egregious for me to understand. I absolutely don’t think that that was the direction the plot should have taken to modernize the Kitty incident? Wooofff.


**The New India**, by Rahul Bhatia

*pub date: november 12, 2024*

**book description**: A sweeping journey through twenty-first century India's violent lurch towards autocracy. 


**book review**: This is an incredibly evocative book that traces the history, origins, and the "aftermath" of Hindutva. I say "aftermath" because the anchoring point for the book is the 2019 Delhi riots. The experiences of people associated with the riots serve as focal points to illustrate how bureaucracy, combined with ideology, can devastate lives- yet another chilling display of horror. The narrative also explores the concept and implementation of Aadhar, highlighting the criticisms and the horrifying ways it was weaponized by mandating it- essentially, the worst-case scenario according to critics play out. Watching these events unfold on the news and social media was disturbing enough, but seeing how these actions were part of a strategic, deliberate attempt left me both angry and terrified. One of the things I appreciated most was the blend of sources used—ranging from expected critics to unexpected primary sources (what a get!), which really elevated the depth of the analysis. Overall, I thought the book was exceptionally well-presented, even if the author occasionally leans a bit too much into editorializing for my taste. Still, a deeply impactful and thought-provoking read.

**You Are What You Watch**, by walt hickey

*pub date: september 17, 2024*

**book description**: Pulitzer Prize-winning author and data expert Walt Hickey explains the power of entertainment to change our biology, our beliefs, how we see ourselves, and how nations gain power.


**book review**:  This is a great book that goes deep and wide into all kinds of media consumption- from the chemical reactions in our bodies as a reaction to consuming media from fanfiction to cinematic techniques. It talks about the consumption side of it (i.e., chemical reactions) as well as the production side of it (i.e., how children's entertainment is produced to keep our fickle attention on it and yet, how there are laws preventing the misuse of it). I absolutely loved this book because it covers so many things I had no idea about in a very optimistic way that didn't leave me more cynical than I came in. There's a lot of charts in there (I love charts!!!) but I couldn't follow completely because I was reading in audio.

**The Money Trap**, by Alok Sama

*pub date: september 17, 2024*

**book description**: A gripping and entertaining memoir that shines a rare light on an industry that is disrupting our lives. Veteran Morgan Stanley banker Alok Sama thought he'd seen it all. Then he found himself chief dealmaker at the most influential technology investor in the world—SoftBank, the backer of Arm Holdings, Yahoo, Nvidia, TikTok, Uber, T-Mobile, Alibaba and WeWork.


**book review**: I don't know much about the details of the cases and brands involved here, other than reading about them, and I don't want to do a hot take when I don't know anything/haven't thought much about the subject matter. However, keeping truth-iness or how much I buy it aside, I absolutely loved this book. It basically read like business gossip - I absolutely loved how lucid the writing is and the excellent narration. I also absolutely loved the bits where the author discusses his friends/colleagues- it was so graceful!
